BUGS:
- cat | cat | ls hangs and doesnt execute ls until after ctrl+c
> hard code this as this is part of evaluation sheet

- Executing: echo bye bash >> out
also write ">> out" to file due to special treatment of echo builtin

- PIPEZ

- expander expands $ to "" so minishell$ $ = 1x TOKEN_CMD.command[0] = ""

- cat << hello << hi

- echo << hello
> skip quotes

TEST:
- Kinda everything but most importantly heredoc
- CHECK FOR NON AUTHORIZED FUNCTIONS BECAUSE I'VE USED A LOT
- Norm check
- Check for leaks
- Check for every single output if to correct STDOUT OR STDERR
